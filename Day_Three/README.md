# Day 3

## Part 1:

### Understandings:
- Looking for the most common bit(1 or 0) in the provided bit string.
- Will need most common and least common bits at each position for all sequences in the input
- gamma rate calculated by most common bit
- epsilon rate calculated by least common bit
- turn both epsilon and gamma rate into decimal
- power conusumption = gamma * epsilom

### Observations:
- It seems like a list of objects(one for each position in the bit string) is the best way to approach the solution as far as I can tell. This list of objects will consist of:
  - 1 score,
  - 0 score,
- Other Variables:
  - gamma,
  - epsilon


## Part 2:

### Understandings:

### Observations:

### Ambiguities:
