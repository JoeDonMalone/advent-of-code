# Day 1

## Part 1:

### Understandings:
- Initially, there will be no previous scan or 'measurements'
- I consider measurements to mean, reads-per-measurement. It seems like this is what they are saying. I will be given the input of a single measurement consisting of n reads. 
- I will need to determine if each read is positive(deeper) or negative(more shallow) and count the total number or positive reads before the next measurement(step 2?)

### Observations:
- There will be at least two variables to keep track of:
    - previous 'read' value (to compare to current 'read' value)
    - count of positive(deeper) 'reads'
- <b>Every</b> 'read' deeper than the previous 'read' counts as a depth increase, and counts towards the total score (Doesn't have to be the deepest depth reached so far to count)
